<h2 align="center"><u>Beloved</u></h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;"><u>Toni Morrison’s</u>1987 spiritual and <i><b>haunting</i></b> novel <u>Beloved</u> tells the story of an escaped slave named Sethe who has fled to Cincinnati, Ohio, in the year 1873. 
The novel investigates the trauma of <i><b>slavery</i></b> even after <i><b>freedom</i></b> has been gained, depicting Sethe’s guilt and emotional pain after having killed her own child, whom she named <u>Beloved,</u> to keep her from living life as a slave.
A spectral figure appears in the lives of the characters and goes by the same name as the child, <i><b>embodying</i></b> the family’s <i><b>anguish</i></b> and <i><b>hardship</i></b> and making their feelings and past <i><b>unavoidable</i></b>.
The novel was lauded for addressing the <i><b>psychological effects of slavery</i></b> and the importance of family and community in healing. Beloved was awarded the<i><b> Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988</i></b>.
